# Adding your Dotfiles
To add your dots simply open a pull request:
  1. Fork this repository.
  2. Add your entry to the `themes` folder. Add the `mainfest.yaml` file, then add 1 to 5 images.
  3. If you want a particular image to be shown on the main page preview rename it to `thumbnail`. This is optional.
  4. Open a pull request and it's done!

<br>

The YAML file looks like this:
```yaml
author: I am the author
title: This is the title
description: This is a short description
link: # Theme repository URL    
reddit: # Optional link to UnixPorn post
wm: windowmanager
tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3'] 
```

NOTE: Please try to make sure the image has a 16:9 aspect ratio for consistency
